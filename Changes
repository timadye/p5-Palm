	* cleaned up the pod coverage test.
	* add License and Author stuff to the distro

2007-01-15	brian d foy <bdfoy@cpan.org>

	* chromatic sent me some changes living in another distro
	(p5-Palm-1.004_000). It catches up 1.003_000 for all of the
	changes since November 2002 listed in this file.
	
2007-01-13	brian d foy <bdfoy@cpan.org>

	* Cleansed the dist to make it installable by CPAN tools.
	It just needs a version without a _ in it.

2004-04-15 21:21  christophe

	* Palm/PDB.pm, util/pdbdump: Added some logic to detect broken
	databases during loading:
	
	- database names _must_ contain the terminating NUL within the
	first 32 characters of the header. This catches obviously broken
	situations like text files renamed to .pdb files (which, oddly
	enough, happens a lot when you're trying to process text files into
	Doc files).
	
	- position offsets mustn't go beyond the end of the database file
	($pdb->{_size}).  This indicates either truncation of the db or
	straight corruption.

2004-04-08 22:55  christophe

	* Palm/PDB.pm: make it impossible to create a nameless database. It
	can't be uploaded to the PDA, that's for sure.

	* Palm/PDB.pm: now now takes an optional hash with default values.

2002-06-16 09:37  azummo

	attributes using "official"  names

2002-05-09 11:08  arensb

	* Palm/Address.pm: Again, more sanity-checking and a little less
	code duplication.

2002-05-09 10:33  arensb

	* Palm/Address.pm: More sanity checks, and a somewhat more elegant
	way of doing things (iterate over field names, rather than
	duplicating code a bunch of times).

2002-05-09 10:24  arensb

	* Palm/StdAppInfo.pm: (bug fix) Used to do some sanity-checking,
	then ignored it. We now pay attention to our own sanity checks.

2002-04-09 20:59  arensb

	* README: Added Keni as a contributor.

2002-04-09 20:58  arensb

	brain-damaged.

2001-06-05 08:52  arensb

	* TODO: Removed an item.

2001-06-02 15:17  arensb

	attribute. Better check for non-NULLness of AppInfo block.

2000-09-25 01:06  arensb

	StdAppInfo.pm, ToDo.pm: $VERSION is now a floating-point number,
	for comparison.

2000-09-24 12:24  arensb

	* TODO: Added an item.

2000-09-20 10:16  arensb

	* Palm/StdAppInfo.pm: Removed a "to do" comment.

2000-09-16 19:58  arensb

	* Makefile.PL: Bumped up patchlevel number.

2000-09-16 19:58  arensb

	* Palm/PDB.pm: (bug fix): The two useless NULs are allowed, but not
	mandated, by the spec. By assuming that they will always be there,
	this module failed to parse some well-formed PDBs.

2000-09-16 19:57  arensb

	* util/pdbdump: Oops! Forgot to fix resources.	Minor cleaning.

2000-09-16 19:53  arensb

	* util/pdbdump: (bug fix): The two useless NULs are allowed, but
	not mandated, by the spec. By assuming that they will always be
	there, 'pdbdump' failed to parse some well-formed PDBs.

2000-09-09 00:52  arensb

	* Makefile.PL: Bumped up version number.

2000-09-09 00:50  arensb

	* Palm/StdAppInfo.pm: Added $error variable.  (bug fix): A
	mis-written test would cause &pack_StdAppInfo to omit unnamed
	categories. Hence, the category list had fewer than 16 categories,
	when written.  Fixed typo.  (feature): Added &addCategory,
	&deleteCategory, &renameCategory.  Removed BUGS section.

2000-09-08 22:48  arensb

	* Palm/StdAppInfo.pm: Stop Perl from complaining if there are
	unnamed categories.

2000-09-08 22:47  arensb

2000-08-28 23:20  arensb

	* Makefile.PL: Bumped up the version number.

2000-08-28 23:19  arensb

	* Palm/StdAppInfo.pm: Changed API: the categories are new arranged
	as a 16-element array of category structs, the way they logically
	belong, rather than as disparate arrays, the way they're
	represented in the file.  Added a lot to the POD.

2000-08-28 23:16  arensb

	* TODO: Removed an item.

2000-08-28 23:16  arensb

	<jj@lcs.mit.edu>, to avoid warnings under Perl 5.6, when various
	fields are undefined.

2000-08-13 17:59  arensb

	* Palm/: Address.pm, Datebook.pm, Mail.pm, Memo.pm, ToDo.pm:
	Updated for new &parse_StdAppInfo behavior.

2000-08-13 17:59  arensb

	* Palm/StdAppInfo.pm: (bug fix): &parse_StdAppInfo now puts the
	non-category part of the AppInfo block in $appinfo->{other}. This
	is so that a script that reads a random .pdb file as a StdAppInfo
	(and nothing else) can copy it without loss of data. 
	&pack_StdAppInfo uses $appinfo->{other}.  Clarified documentation
	somewhat.

2000-08-04 00:12  arensb

	* Palm/PDB.pm: Fixed expression that made 'perl5.6 -w' print a
	warning.

2000-08-01 23:20  arensb

	* Makefile.PL: Bumped up version number.

2000-08-01 23:19  arensb

	MS-DOS, and other OSes that make that distinction.

2000-08-01 23:19  arensb

	* Palm/PDB.pm: (bug fix): Read and write files in binary mode under
	Windows, MS-DOS, and other OSes that make that distinction.

2000-07-18 23:57  arensb

	* TODO: Added an item.

2000-07-08 20:25  arensb

	* Palm/PDB.pm: PDB::new now initializes more fields.  PDB::Write
	prints a warning if writing a zero-length record. 
	PDB::new_Resource: type now defaults to all NULs (instead of four
	spaces).

2000-07-08 20:11  arensb

	* Palm/Datebook.pm: Changed a comment.

2000-06-30 11:41  arensb

	* Makefile.PL: Bumped up version number.

	* TODO: Added an item.

2000-06-30 11:41  arensb

	* Palm/Datebook.pm: Made AppInfo block initialization the same as
	other modules, even though Datebook doesn't really use categories
	and such.

2000-06-30 11:40  arensb

	* Palm/StdAppInfo.pm: (bug fix): Use of anonymous array instead of
	a real array caused first category (and first category ID) to be a
	reference rather than a "real" scalar.

2000-05-23 02:56  arensb

	* Makefile.PL: Incremented patchlevel number.

2000-05-23 02:55  arensb

	* Palm/: Address.pm, Memo.pm: (bug fix): Don't run
	StdAppInfo::import(). This prevents StdAppInfo from registering
	itself as the default handler in generic tools.

	* Makefile.PL: Bumped up version number.

2000-05-13 16:29  arensb

	"sent_to").  Patch supplied by Sumant S.R. Oemrawsingh
	<sikander@stad.dsl.nl>

2000-05-13 01:16  arensb

	* Makefile.PL: Incremented patch level.  Added "pdbdump" to the
	distribution.

2000-05-13 01:15  arensb

	* MANIFEST: Ship "pdbdump" instead of "dumpdb".

2000-05-13 01:15  arensb

	* util/dumpdb: Some obsolete refinements.

2000-05-13 01:14  arensb

	* Palm/StdAppInfo.pm: Added an import() function, so you can say
	that a function is a Palm::StdAppInfo.

2000-05-13 01:12  arensb

	* Palm/Mail.pm: (bug fix): Palm::Mail::new_Record() didn't return a
	value.	Don't import StdAppInfo, since don't want new PDBs to
	default to StdAppInfo.

2000-05-08 05:48  arensb

	* util/pdbdump: Rewritten from scratch. This is basically just
	Palm/PDB.pm with trace statements.

	methods.

2000-02-01 23:19  arensb

	* Palm/: Datebook.pm, Mail.pm, Memo.pm, ToDo.pm: Rearranged the
	POD. Added &new, &new_Record methods.

2000-02-01 23:18  arensb

	* Palm/: Mail.pm, Memo.pm: Added $VERSION variable, per CPAN.

2000-02-01 07:19  arensb

2000-01-23 04:18  arensb

	* Palm/PDB.pm: The various _load_*() functions are no longer
	methods, since they shouldn't be overridden anyway.  Added

	append_resource(), findRecordByID(), deleteRecord().

2000-01-23 01:33  arensb

	* util/dumpdb: Bug fix: deal with PDBs without records, and PRCs
	without resources.  Memo: Dump() now prints the AppInfo and sort

	in the AppInfo block.  Address: print the record attributes.

2000-01-23 01:28  arensb

	* Palm/PDB.pm: Updated copyright.  Fixed function cross-references
	in the documentation.  new() method now initializes the common
	fields.  Fiddled with quotes in the documentation some more. 
	Write() method now supplies the two NULs if they're missing.  Added
	methods: new_Record(), append_Record(), new_Resource(),
	append_Resource(), findRecordByID(), deleteRecord().

	* Palm/Address.pm: Added new() method, to specifically create a new
	Address PDB.  Added new_Record() method, to create a new Address
	record.  Bug fix: PackAppInfoBlock() only packed whichever
	categories were defined. It now makes sure that it packs 16
	categories.
